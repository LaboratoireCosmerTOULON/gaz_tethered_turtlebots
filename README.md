This package generates a SDF model of two turtlebots connected by a orange rope.
A base-model named "tethered_turtlebots_BASEMODEL.sdf" is generated by the Python script:

<code>
python model_creator.py
</code>

This base-model can be modificated by displacing the leader robot (turtlebot1) in order to obtain different tether shapes.
Such modifications are done running

<code>
python model_setup.py
</code>

that generates a new model "tethered_turtlebots.sdf" corresponding to the entered tether feature vector s = (a,b)
