This package generates a SDF model of two turtlebots connected by an orange rope.
A base-model named "tethered_turtlebots_BASEMODEL.sdf" is generated by the Python script:

<code>
python model_creator.py
</code>

This base-model can be modificated by the following script in order to obtain different tether shapes:

<code>
python model_setup.py a b
</code>
where a=h/hmax and b=sin(theta) are the catenary parameters of the tether. The new model is saved in "tethered_turtlebots.sdf" corresponding

A simulation of the tethered turtlebots can be launched on Gazebo entering:

<code>
roslaunch gaz_tethered_turtlebots gaz_tethered_turtlebots.launch a0:=0.5 b0:=0.5
</code>
